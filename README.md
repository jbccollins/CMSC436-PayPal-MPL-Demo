This is a demo application for the PayPal Mobile Payment Library. It is a bare bones, but fully functional Android application that can be used as a reference when creating a more fleshed out application. The PayPal MPL Presentation PDF was created as part of a class project and goes more in depth explaining how all the different parts fit together.
